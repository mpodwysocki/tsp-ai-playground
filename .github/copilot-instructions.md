This is a repository for creating TypeSpec shared libraries and exemplar services.

We use the latest TypeSpec with the latest features.  When creating our services, we use the modern versioning using the Versioning library here https://typespec.io/docs/libraries/versioning/guide/

When suggesting bringing in a feature for TypeSpec, ensure that the library it comes from and tell me to install it if it has not been installed already.

We would prefer to have comments for all fields and operations.  This is to ensure that we have documentation for all of our fields and operations.  We will use the /// for documentation.  This is the same as the @doc, but it is more readable in the code.  We will use this for all fields and operations.

We use spaces and not tabs, 2 spaces for indentation.

When creating operations, prefer to use an alias with the parameter or header name.  This allows for reuse as we can use the alias in other operations.

We will use the latest version of TypeSpec.  If you are not sure what the latest version is, please check the TypeSpec website https://typespec.io/ and use that version.  If you are not sure, please ask me.
