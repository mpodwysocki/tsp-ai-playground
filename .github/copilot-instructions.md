This is a repository for creating TypeSpec shared libraries and exemplar services.

We use the latest TypeSpec with the latest features.  When creating our services, we use the modern versioning using the Versioning library here https://typespec.io/docs/libraries/versioning/reference/

We prefer to use the /// versus @doc for documentation
