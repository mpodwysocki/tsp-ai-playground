This is a repository for creating TypeSpec shared libraries and exemplar services.

We use the latest TypeSpec with the latest features.  When creating our services, we use the modern versioning using the Versioning library here https://typespec.io/docs/libraries/versioning/guide/

When suggesting bringing in a feature for TypeSpec, ensure that the library it comes from and tell me to install it if it has not been installed already.

We prefer to use the /// versus @doc for documentation

We use spaces and not tabs, 2 spaces for indentation.
